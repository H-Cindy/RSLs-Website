        <h2>Resources on Campus</h2>

		<h2>Teams</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Terracycle</li>
			<li>Dining: The Dining/Eateries subteam deals with sustainability issues within dining halls and eateries on campus. As students who regularly frequent these locations, we are uniquely familiar with their sustainability issues and seek to develop solutions to these problems.</li> 
			<li>Sustainable Room Certification: Our group is currently working on launching an engagement program within residential dorms that ranks students’ living habits based on their sustainability efforts. To successfully launch this program, we are tailoring a survey that aims to accurately capture students’ daily habits and preferences while keeping in mind how we could further motivate and promote sustainable lifestyles.</li>
			<li>Educational Outreach</li>
			<!-- <li>Cornell Reuse and Repair Network</li> -->
			<li>Website: The web development team creates and maintains an up-to-date organization website.</li>
		</ul>

		<!-- <h2>Past Projects</h2>
